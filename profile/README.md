- :octocat: Check out the [source code].

Evy bridges the gap between block-based languages like [Scratch] and
conventional languages like Python or JavaScript. It has a minimalist syntax
with fewer special characters and advanced concepts than most programming
languages. Evy has a small set of [built-in functions] that are easy to
understand and remember, but it still is powerful enough for user
interaction, games, and animations.

However, the Evy platform is more than just a programming language. It aspires to
be the "Khan Academy for Code", with mastery-based learning, a comprehensive
library of exercises and explanations, and a gradual progression of
concepts. Check out the [Learn and Practice] resources on the Evy wiki.
